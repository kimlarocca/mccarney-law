                            <p>The Firm has been a pioneer in the whistleblower arena, having handled such matters well
                                before

                                insight has
                                proven invaluable in assisting clients on the defense side when confronted with
                                whistleblower
                                investigations or litigations.</p>

                            <p>Breaches of Campus Security occur with greater frequency than the public is generally
                                aware.
                                Instances of violent and other crimes, including murder, rape and sexual assault, are
                                now subject to
                                mandatory annual disclosure by institutions of higher learning as a precondition to
                                receipt of
                                federal funding under the Jeanne Clery Campus Security Act (20 USC § 1092(f)). In an
                                attempt to
                                reduce liability for the large volume of cases, the universities defend these cases with
                                inordinate
                                vigor, often with little or no regard for the welfare of their students. The Firm’s
                                experience in
                                this area and working relationship with leading experts in campus security and

                                Syndrome (“PTSD”) serves to overcome these defenses. Invariably the perpetrators of the
                                crimes are
                                brought to justice, security at the universities is improved substantially, and monetary
                                payments
                                are made as some measure of compensation for the damage that has been done.
